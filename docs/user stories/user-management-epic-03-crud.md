# Epic 3: User Management Core (CRUD) â€“ User Stories

## As an admin, I want to create new users with validated input

### Description
Allow admins to create user records with strict validation to ensure data integrity and compliance with business rules.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use schema validation (Joi/Zod)
- Enforce required fields, formats, and unique constraints
- Validate on both frontend and backend

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All user fields validated per requirements
- [x] Duplicate emails are rejected
- [x] Errors are clear and actionable
- [x] Tests cover all validation rules

### Potential Tasks
- [x] Implement frontend and backend validation
- [x] Add unique constraints in database
- [x] Write validation tests

### Dependencies
- Authentication implemented

### Implementation
- Define a user schema using Joi or Zod for validation.
- Implement backend validation middleware to enforce schema rules.
- Add frontend form validation that mirrors backend rules.
- Ensure unique constraints are set at the database level (e.g., unique index on email).
- Return clear, actionable error messages on validation failure.
- Write unit and integration tests to cover validation logic.
- Document validation rules for future reference.

- [x] Bulk delete is transactional and auditable

### Potential Tasks
- [x] Implement CRUD endpoints and UI
- [x] Add audit logging for all changes
- [x] Support pagination, filtering, and search
- [x] Write CRUD operation tests

### Dependencies
- User creation implemented
- Auditing infrastructure in place

### Implementation
- Design RESTful API endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting users.
- Implement UI components for user listing, editing, and deletion.
- Add optimistic UI updates for a smooth user experience.

- Ensure bulk delete operations are transactional and auditable.
- Add pagination, filtering, and search to user listing.
- Write unit and integration tests for all CRUD operations.
- Document API endpoints and UI workflows.
