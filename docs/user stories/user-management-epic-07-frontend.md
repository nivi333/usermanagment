# Epic 7: Frontend Application (React + Ant Design) â€“ User Stories

## As a user, I want to view and manage users in a responsive, accessible UI

### Description
Provide a user-friendly interface for listing, searching, filtering, and managing users, accessible on all devices and compliant with accessibility standards.

### Industry Best Practices
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility
- Consistent theming and component reuse

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] User list, filters, and details are accessible and responsive
- [x] UI passes accessibility audit (all interactive elements have labels, keyboard navigation supported)
- [x] Theming and spacing are consistent (Ant Design 5.x)

### Implementation Summary
- Responsive user list with Ant Design Table, Card, and Layout
- Search bar and role filter for quick user lookup
- Accessible modals and forms with labels and aria attributes
- Consistent theming and spacing using Ant Design
- Empty state and error handling for clarity
- Code lint and JSX errors fixed for maintainability

### Notes
- UI tested for keyboard and screen reader accessibility
- Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Further enhancements (e.g., advanced filters, export, accessibility scripts) can be added on request

### Potential Tasks
- Implement user list, filter, and detail components
- Test and fix accessibility issues
- Apply theme and style guidelines

### Dependencies
- User management API implemented

### Priority
High

## As a user, I want real-time validation and feedback on all forms

### Description
Ensure all forms (create/edit user) provide immediate validation feedback, improving data quality and user experience.

### Industry Best Practices
- Client-side and server-side validation
- Real-time feedback on errors
- Clear error messages

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All forms validate input in real time (immediate feedback on every change)
- [x] Errors are shown clearly and accessibly (inline messages, accessible labels)

### Implementation Summary
- All user forms (create/edit) now use Ant Design's Form with `validateTrigger="onChange"` for real-time validation
- Error messages appear as soon as input is invalid, not just on blur/submit
- All error messages are clear, accessible, and field-specific
- User experience and data quality are improved
- [ ] Invalid submissions are blocked

### Potential Tasks
- Implement validation logic in forms
- Integrate backend validation feedback
- Write tests for validation flows

### Dependencies
- User management API implemented

### Priority
High

## As a developer, I want error boundaries and loading states for all async operations

### Description
Implement error boundaries and loading indicators to ensure a robust, user-friendly experience during asynchronous operations.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use React error boundaries
- Show loading spinners for async ops
- Log errors for debugging

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error boundaries wrap all async components
- [ ] Loading states are present for all API calls
- [ ] Errors are logged and user-friendly

### Potential Tasks
- Implement error boundary components
- Add loading indicators to all async flows
- Write tests for error and loading states

### Dependencies
- Frontend components implemented

### Priority
Medium

## As a developer, I want the frontend codebase to follow strict linting, formatting, and testing standards

### Description
Ensure the frontend codebase is maintainable, consistent, and high-quality by enforcing linting, formatting, and automated test coverage.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode
- Require tests for all critical paths
- Integrate checks in CI/CD pipeline

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Codebase passes all lint, format, and type checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode)
- [x] Automated tests cover critical user journeys (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Checks run in CI/CD pipeline

### Implementation Summary
- Strict ESLint config for React, TypeScript, accessibility, and Prettier
- Prettier config for consistent formatting
- Jest config with coverage enforcement
- Scripts in package.json: lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, test:coverage
- All code must pass lint, formatting, and tests before merging

### Usage Notes
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` before each commit
- Use `npm run test:coverage` to ensure critical paths are tested
- Integrate these scripts in CI/CD for automated enforcement

### Potential Tasks
- Configure ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript
- Write and maintain automated tests
- Integrate checks in CI pipeline

### Dependencies
- Frontend codebase implemented
- CI/CD pipeline available
