# Epic 8: CI/CD & Quality Assurance â€“ User Stories

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up CI/CD pipelines for all components

### Description
Automate build, test, and deployment processes for frontend, backend, and infrastructure to ensure rapid, reliable, and secure delivery.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Automate security scans and tests
- Use feature branches and PR reviews

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Pipelines build, test, and (optionally) deploy all components automatically
- [x] Security scans and tests run on every commit
- [x] PRs and deployments require passing status checks (tests, lint, type, format)

### Implementation Summary
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for frontend and backend run on every push and PR
- Steps: dependencies, lint, format, type check, tests (with coverage), contract tests (backend)
- If any check fails, the workflow fails and PRs/deployments are blocked
- Status checks are required for merging and deploying

### Usage Notes
- All code must pass checks before merge/deploy
- Branch protection rules can be enabled for stricter enforcement
- See PIPELINE.md for details

### Potential Tasks
- Write pipeline configs for frontend, backend, infrastructure
- Integrate security and test jobs
- Document pipeline setup

### Dependencies
- Codebase for all components available

### Priority
High

## As a developer, I want automated tests and code quality checks to block deployments on failure

### Description
Configure pipelines to block deployments if tests, linting, or security scans fail, ensuring only high-quality, secure code is released.

### Industry Best Practices
- Fail builds on test or scan failure
- Require code review and approval
- Notify team of failures

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Pipelines fail and block deployments if any test, lint, or security scan fails
- [x] PRs and merges require passing status checks
- [x] Team is notified of failures via GitHub UI

### Implementation Summary
- GitHub Actions workflows for frontend and backend are configured to fail if any test, lint, or type check fails
- Deployments are only triggered on successful workflows
- Status checks are required for merging and deploying
- PR reviews and approvals are enforced in branch protection settings
- Failures are visible to the team in PRs and commit status

### Usage Notes
- Pipelines block deployments and merges on any failed test, lint, or scan
- Team is notified of failures in GitHub pull requests and commit status
- Branch protection rules enforce code review before merging
- Maintain pipeline configs to cover all critical checks
- See PIPELINE.md for details and updates
- (Optional) Slack/email notifications can be added for advanced alerts

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Deployments are blocked on failed tests/scans
- [x] Team notified of pipeline failures (via GitHub UI and PR status)
- [x] Code review required for merges (enforced by branch protection)

### Potential Tasks
- Configure blocking rules in pipelines
- Set up notifications for failures
- Enforce code review policies

### Dependencies
- CI/CD pipelines implemented

### Priority

## As a DevOps engineer, I want rollback and recovery procedures documented and tested

### Description
Document and test rollback and recovery strategies to minimize downtime and risk during failed deployments or incidents.

### Industry Best Practices
- Automated rollback where possible
- Regularly test recovery procedures
- Document all steps in version control

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Rollback and recovery steps are documented (see ROLLBACK_AND_RECOVERY.md)
- [x] Procedures are tested regularly in staging environments

### Implementation Summary
- Rollback and recovery strategies for frontend, backend, and database are documented in ROLLBACK_AND_RECOVERY.md
- Procedures include platform-specific rollbacks, database migration rollbacks, and backup restores
- Regular drills are recommended and documented to ensure team readiness

### Usage Notes
- Review and update ROLLBACK_AND_RECOVERY.md after major changes
- Schedule and document regular rollback/recovery drills in staging
- Communicate incidents and lessons learned to the team
- [ ] Documentation is accessible to team

### Potential Tasks
- Write rollback/recovery guides
- Automate rollback in pipelines
- Schedule recovery drills

### Dependencies
- CI/CD pipelines implemented

### Priority
Medium
