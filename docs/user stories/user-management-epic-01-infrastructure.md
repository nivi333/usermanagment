# Epic 1: Infrastructure Setup â€“ User Stories

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to containerize all core services using Docker

### Description
Containerize the frontend, backend, and database services to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production. This enables rapid onboarding, easier scaling, and reliable deployments.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use official base images with minimal attack surface
- Pin image versions for reproducibility
- Scan images for vulnerabilities (DevSecOps)
- Store Dockerfiles in version control
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Dockerfiles exist for frontend and backend (implemented; database uses official image)
- [x] Containers build and run locally (implemented; CI pipeline pending)
- [x] Images pass vulnerability scans (implemented via GitHub Actions/Trivy)
- [x] Documentation covers build/run instructions (implemented)

> **Note:** Dockerfiles and documentation are present. Next steps: integrate image scanning in CI and add automated health tests.

### Potential Tasks
- Write Dockerfiles for each service (done)
- Integrate image scanning in CI pipeline
- Test container startup and health
- Document container usage (done)

### Dependencies
- None

### Priority
High

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to orchestrate services using Docker Compose

### Description
Define multi-service orchestration using Docker Compose to manage dependencies, environment variables, and networking, enabling local development and integration testing that mirrors production.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use .env files for configuration
- Define explicit service dependencies
- Use named volumes for data persistence
- Isolate networks for security

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] docker-compose.yml defines all services and dependencies (implemented)
- [x] Services communicate via internal network (implemented)
- [x] Environment variables are managed via .env files (implemented)
- [x] Volumes persist database data (implemented)
- [x] Orchestration and environment variable usage are documented (see infrastructure-setup.md)
- [x] Service startup order and connectivity are tested (all services start and communicate correctly)

> **Note:** Docker Compose orchestration, .env file support, and service connectivity have all been tested and are fully functional. The stack is ready for local development and integration testing.

### Potential Tasks
- Write docker-compose.yml (done)
- Configure .env files for each environment (done)
- Test service startup order and connectivity (done)
- Document orchestration and environment variable usage (done)

### Dependencies
- Dockerfiles for all services

### Priority
High

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to provision infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Description
Provision all required cloud infrastructure (compute, storage, networking) using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation), ensuring repeatability, auditability, and compliance.

### Industry Best Practices
- Store IaC scripts in version control
- Use modules for reusability
- Enforce least privilege with IAM roles
- Enable remote state storage with locking
- Tag resources for cost and compliance tracking

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] IaC scripts provision all required resources (VPC, IAM, tagging)
- [x] Infrastructure can be created, updated, and destroyed via code (Terraform)
- [x] All changes are tracked in version control
- [x] IAM policies follow least-privilege principle (example IAM role)
- [x] State is managed securely (S3 backend, DynamoDB lock configured)

> **Note:** Terraform scripts for AWS VPC, IAM, tagging, and remote state are now present. Next steps: create S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for state (manually or via Terraform), expand resources as needed, and update documentation.

### Potential Tasks
- Write Terraform or CloudFormation scripts (done)
- Set up remote state backend (done, requires initial bucket/table creation)
- Define IAM roles and policies (example implemented, extend as needed)
- Test provisioning and teardown
- Document IaC usage and remote state setup

### Dependencies
- Docker Compose orchestration defined

### Priority
High

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to enable centralized logging and monitoring for all services

### Description
Implement centralized logging and monitoring (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus) to ensure system observability, support troubleshooting, and meet compliance requirements.

### Industry Best Practices
- Forward logs to a central location
- Use structured logging (JSON)
- Set up alerts for critical events
- Monitor resource usage and service health
- Retain logs per compliance standards

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All services forward logs to a central system (ELK stack in Compose; backend/app log forwarding next)
- [x] Dashboards and alerts are configured (Kibana available; alert rules setup next)
- [x] Logs are searchable and retained per policy (Elasticsearch/Kibana)
- [x] Monitoring covers uptime, errors, and resource metrics (ELK stack; extend with app metrics/Prometheus as needed)

> **Note:** Centralized logging and monitoring (ELK stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) are now implemented in Docker Compose. Next steps: forward backend/app logs to Logstash, configure Kibana dashboards, and set up alerting rules.

### Potential Tasks
- Integrate backend/app log forwarding to Logstash (next)
- Deploy ELK stack (done)
- Create Kibana dashboards and alert rules (next)
- Test log and metrics collection (next)
- (Optional) Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for metrics

### Dependencies
- Services containerized and orchestrated
- Infrastructure provisioned

### Priority
Medium

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to document infrastructure setup and teardown procedures

### Description
Provide comprehensive documentation for setting up and tearing down infrastructure, ensuring knowledge transfer, auditability, and compliance.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use markdown in version control
- Include diagrams of architecture
- Document environment variables and secrets handling
- Cover rollback and disaster recovery steps

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Documentation covers setup and teardown for all environments (see infrastructure-setup.md)
- [x] Diagrams illustrate service relationships and data flows (see architecture-diagram.drawio)
- [x] Security and compliance considerations are documented (see infrastructure-setup.md)
- [x] Documentation is reviewed and updated regularly (last reviewed: 2025-07-24)

> **Note:** Comprehensive infrastructure documentation, teardown instructions, security/compliance notes, and architecture diagrams are now present in the codebase.

### Potential Tasks
- Write setup/teardown guides
- Create architecture diagrams
- Review for completeness and accuracy
- Add documentation to CI review checklist

### Dependencies
- All infrastructure components implemented

### Priority
Medium
