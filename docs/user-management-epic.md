# User Management System â€“ Enterprise Epics

## Epic 1: Infrastructure Setup

### Description

### Best Practices
- Use Docker for containerization and Docker Compose for orchestration.
- Provision infrastructure using IaC (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation).
- Implement environment parity (dev/stage/prod) with .env files.
- Enforce network segmentation, secure secrets management, and least-privilege access.
- Enable centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus).
- Prepare for CI/CD integration and automated testing.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All core services (frontend, backend, database) are containerized with Docker.
- [ ] Docker Compose configures service dependencies and environment variables.
- [ ] Infrastructure can be provisioned, updated, and destroyed via IaC scripts.
- [ ] Secure secrets management is in place (no hardcoded credentials).
- [ ] Logging and monitoring are enabled for all services.
- [ ] System can be deployed to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) with minimal manual steps.
- [ ] Documentation covers infrastructure setup and teardown.

## Epic 2: Authentication & Authorization

### Description
Implement secure authentication and role-based authorization for all system components, ensuring compliance with zero-trust security principles and enterprise standards.

### Best Practices
- Use JWT or OAuth2 for stateless authentication.
- Enforce strong password policies and secure password storage (bcrypt/scrypt).
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with granular permissions.
- Use HTTPS/TLS everywhere; enforce CORS policies.
- Integrate with enterprise SSO/identity providers (optional, extensible).
- Protect all endpoints with authentication middleware.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users must authenticate to access any protected resource.
- [ ] Passwords are hashed and never stored in plaintext.
- [ ] JWT tokens are signed, validated, and expire appropriately.
- [ ] RBAC is enforced at API and UI levels (e.g., Admin, Manager, User roles).
- [ ] CORS and HTTPS are enabled and tested.
- [ ] All authentication/authorization logic is covered by automated tests.
- [ ] Security audit is performed on authentication flows.

## Epic 3: User Management Core (CRUD)

### Description
Deliver a full-featured user management module enabling creation, retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD) of user records with enterprise-grade validation, auditability, and error handling.

### Best Practices
- Strict input validation and error handling on both frontend and backend.
- Use TypeScript types and schema validation (e.g., Joi, Zod).
- Implement optimistic UI updates and graceful error boundaries.
- Enforce uniqueness and integrity constraints at the database level.
- Support bulk operations with transactional safety.
- Provide clear, actionable error messages and notifications.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can be created, viewed, updated, and deleted via API and UI.
- [ ] All user fields are validated per requirements (type, format, enums, required fields).
- [ ] Pagination, filtering, and search are available on user list endpoints.
- [ ] Bulk delete operation is transactional and auditable.
- [ ] All CRUD operations are logged for auditing.
- [ ] Automated tests cover all user flows and edge cases.

## Epic 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Description
Establish a flexible and extensible RBAC system to manage user permissions across modules, ensuring compliance with least-privilege and segregation-of-duties principles.

### Best Practices
- Define roles and their permissions in a centralized, configurable manner.
- Enforce permissions at both API and UI layers.
- Support role assignment and updates by authorized admins.
- Allow for future integration with external IAM solutions.
- Audit all role and permission changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User) and permissions are defined and enforced.
- [ ] Only authorized users can assign or modify roles.
- [ ] Permission checks are implemented in backend middleware and frontend guards.
- [ ] All role/permission changes are logged and auditable.
- [ ] Automated tests validate RBAC enforcement and edge cases.

## Epic 5: Auditing & Compliance

### Description
Implement comprehensive auditing and compliance features to track all critical actions, support regulatory requirements, and enable forensic analysis.

### Best Practices
- Log all sensitive operations (user CRUD, role changes, authentication events).
- Store audit logs in a tamper-evident and centralized system.
- Provide APIs and UI for audit log access (with RBAC restrictions).
- Ensure logs include who, what, when, and where for each event.
- Retain logs per compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOC2).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical actions are logged with full context.
- [ ] Audit logs are immutable and protected from tampering.
- [ ] Only authorized roles can view audit logs.
- [ ] Audit log APIs support filtering, pagination, and export.
- [ ] Compliance with data retention and privacy standards is documented.

## Epic 6: API Design & Documentation

### Description
Deliver a well-documented, versioned REST API aligned with OpenAPI/Swagger standards, facilitating internal and third-party integration.

### Best Practices
- Use RESTful conventions and consistent resource naming.
- Document all endpoints, schemas, and error codes in OpenAPI.
- Version APIs (e.g., /api/v1) and manage backward compatibility.
- Provide example requests/responses for each endpoint.
- Validate all inputs/outputs against schemas.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints are documented in Swagger/OpenAPI and accessible via UI.
- [ ] API versioning is enforced and documented.
- [ ] Example payloads and error codes are provided.
- [ ] Contract tests ensure documentation matches implementation.
- [ ] API documentation is updated with every release.

## Epic 7: Frontend Application (React + Ant Design)

### Description
Build a responsive, accessible, and maintainable frontend using React, Ant Design, and TypeScript, supporting all user management features and enterprise UX standards.

### Best Practices
- Follow 12-factor app principles for frontend config and deployment.
- Use modular, reusable components and strict TypeScript types.
- Enforce accessibility (WCAG 2.1), responsive design, and keyboard navigation.
- Integrate with backend APIs securely (Axios, env-based config).
- Implement error boundaries, loading states, and notifications.
- Ensure code quality with ESLint, Prettier, and automated tests.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements (user list, CRUD, dashboard, filters, etc.) are implemented.
- [ ] UI is fully responsive and accessible.
- [ ] All forms have real-time validation and feedback.
- [ ] Error boundaries and loading states are present for all async ops.
- [ ] Codebase passes linting and formatting checks.
- [ ] Automated UI tests cover critical user journeys.

- Run static analysis, linting, and security scans on every commit.
- Automate container builds, tests, and deployments.
- Use feature branches, PR reviews, and semantic versioning.
- Integrate automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) in pipelines.
