# Rollback and Recovery Procedures

## Overview
This document describes the steps to safely rollback and recover the user-management system in the event of a failed deployment or incident. All procedures should be tested regularly and updated as the system evolves.

## 1. Rollback Strategies

### Frontend
- **Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages**: Use the platform's UI to revert to a previous successful deployment.
- **Manual**: Redeploy the last known-good build artifact.
- **CI/CD**: Trigger a redeploy of a previous commit using the CI/CD provider.

### Backend
- **Docker**: Revert to the previous image tag (e.g., `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d backend@<previous-tag>`).
- **Heroku/Cloud**: Use the platform's rollback feature to redeploy the last successful release.
- **Manual**: Checkout the previous commit, rebuild, and redeploy.

### Database
- **Migrations**: Use migration tools (e.g., `knex migrate:rollback`) to revert schema changes.
- **Backups**: Restore from the latest backup if data corruption occurs.

## 2. Recovery Procedures

1. **Identify the failure** using logs, monitoring, and alerts.
2. **Communicate** with stakeholders and the team.
3. **Rollback code** (see above) or apply hotfix if appropriate.
4. **Restore database** from backup if needed.
5. **Verify system health** (run smoke tests, check monitoring dashboards).
6. **Document the incident** and update procedures.

---

## 3. Testing Procedures
- Schedule regular (e.g., quarterly) rollback and recovery drills.
- Use staging environments to practice procedures without impacting production.
- After each drill, review and improve documentation.

---

## 4. Best Practices
- Automate rollbacks where possible (e.g., failed deployment triggers auto-rollback).
- Always keep recent backups of database and critical assets.
- Version-control this document and update after every major change.
